By walking through each part of the code and explaining the economic intuition behind it, we gain insights into how agents make decisions in an uncertain environment and how these decisions impact the overall economy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Note:** The code above is designed to be run in Dynare, a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models.
